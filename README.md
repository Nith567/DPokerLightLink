The contract DICEPOKERGAME given 1000DPK to the  winner :0x99F5F819ce26480732523f0a195B51424ece71Ca

You can see all the transaction, few of them are for rolling dice for first time, also rerolling the dice for selected dice example shown in the demo, we see in demo the first user got 6,1,6,6,6(four of a kind) still he went for reroll for the second dice '1'(to change 2nd dice,we internally take this as an array of which second position marking it as '1' requesting the length which is one in this case) to expect five of a kind and get five of a kind to get all hightime rank.Well for few functions we would like to automate in future,even for transferring coins directly to winners, without need to claim.
Track all transcations happened here:
